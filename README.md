# Organization
The folders with code files are project-specific, while the "Output" folder includes figures and tables for both projects in a semi-organized fashion. Extraneous code files and outputs abound. The "NewGrant" folder includes a simple test for which infant IDs can be identified in the claims data and birth records files.
